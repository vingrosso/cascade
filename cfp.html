<h1>Call for papers</h1>
<p>
    The program committee is seeking original papers on all aspects of design, development, deployment, evaluation, and application of cryptographic implementations and secure embedded systems. You are invited to participate and submit your contributions to CASCADE'26. Submissions across a broad range of the development phase are encouraged, from exploratory research and proof-of-concept studies to practical applications and deployment.
</p>
<p>
    In addition to original research papers, the program committee also invites:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Survey papers that summarize the evolution of a theory, concept, or technique.</li>
    <li>Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) papers that assess, systematize, and contextualize existing knowledge.</li>
    <li>Data papers that describe a dataset and explain the circumstances of their collection.</li>
</ul>
<p>

<h3>Instruction for authors </h3>
<p>
Submissions must be original, unpublished, anonymous and not submitted to journals or other conferences or workshops with proceedings. Submissions must be written in English and should be at most 20 pages in total (excluding references and appendices) strictly following Springer's LNCS format (with default margins, font size, etc.). There is no limit on the length of the bibliography and appendices when submitting. However, the reviewers are not required to read any appendices and the camera-ready version should be self-contained without appendices and strictly adhere to the page limit. Papers not meeting these guidelines risk rejection without consideration. All submissions will be blind-refereed. Submission implies the willingness of at least one of the authors to register and present the paper. The proceedings will be published in the Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series. Both submissions and accepted papers must follow the  LNCS default author instructions accessible on the Springer webpage: <a href="https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines">https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines</a> .

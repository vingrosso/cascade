<h1>Call for papers</h1>

<p>
CASCADE = CARDIS + COSADE is a new conference focused on cryptographic implementations, physical attacks and embedded security. CASCADE aims to provide a platform for academic and industrial researchers to present their work and discuss their current research topics. Since 1994, CARDIS has been the venue for security experts from industry and academia to exchange on security of smart cards and related applications. Since 2010, COSADE has been an additional venue with dedicated focus on side-channel analysis, implementation attacks and secure designs. Starting in 2025, CARDIS and COSADE will merge into CASCADE, creating a unique annual international event to gather the community. For its first edition, CASCADE will take place in Saint-Étienne (France), from 2 to 4 April, 2025.

<h3>Topics  </h3>
<p>
The program committee is seeking original papers on all aspects of design, development, deployment, evaluation, and application of cryptographic implementations and secure embedded systems. You are invited to participate and submit your contributions to CASCADE'25. Submissions across a broad range of the development phase are encouraged, from exploratory research and proof-of-concept studies to practical applications and deployment. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

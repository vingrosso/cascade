    <h1>Review Process</h1>
    <p>One of the goals of CASCADE is to develop a network for young researchers in Europe. In order to increase the interest for young researchers, we give here some guidelines for reviews. These review guidelines should help to understand the review process.<\p>
    <h2>REVIEW GUIDELINES</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Try to write the reviews that you would like to receive as authors and remember that reviews can fall in the hands of a first-year PhD student.</li>
        <li> Try to be concrete in the the parts of the review related to technical and editorial issues.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Review Process</h1>
    <p>One of the goals of CASCADE is to develop a network for young researchers in Europe. In order to increase the interest for young researchers, we give here some guidelines for reviews. These review guidelines should help to understand the review process.<\p>
    <h2>Review guidelines</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Try to write the reviews that you would like to receive as authors and remember that reviews can fall in the hands of a first-year PhD student.</li>
        <li> Try to be concrete in the the parts of the review related to technical and editorial issues.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Review structure </h2>
    <p>Here is a proposal for review structure  </p>
    <ul>
        <li> <strong> Paper summary. </strong> Give a succinct and positive description of the paperâ€™s main contributions</li>
        <li> <strong> Suitability. </strong> Does the subject belong to the subject of the conference? For borderline paper does the presentation is sufficient for people in the community? </li>
        <li> <strong> Novelty, methodology and technical correctness: </strong>  </li>
     
    </ul>

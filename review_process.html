Since 1994, CARDIS is the foremost international conference dedicated to smart
card research and applications. Smart cards, or by extension smart devices are
the basis for many secure systems and play a decisive role in ID management. Unlike
events devoted to commercial and application aspects of smart cards, CARDIS
conferences gather researchers and technologists who focused on all aspects of
the design, development, deployment, validation and application of smart cards
or smart personal devices.</p>

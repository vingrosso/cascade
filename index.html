            <h2>CASCADE 2025  will be held in Saint-Etienne, FR, on April 2 to 4, 2025. </h2>


            <p>
            CASCADE is a new conference issue from the merge of COSADE and Cardis. The main goal of the conference is to encourage exchange on security of hardware devices in Europe. CASCADE provide an international plateform for researchers, academics, and industry participants to present their work and their current research topics. 
            </p>
            
            <p>         
            CASCADE's primary goals are to be a platform where European PhD students can present their work while benefiting from:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li> a constructive review process privileging technical and editorial feedback over taste,
                <li> interactions with their research community without long-distance travels,
                <li> exposition of industrial challenges that may generate new research discussions.
               
            </ul>
            <p>
 But the conference is naturally open to contributions from more senior or remote researchers. Papers can be submitted for review on two dates (one in the summer, one in the winter) for a single event in April.
            </p>
            <p>
            The first conference will be organized by Universit&eacute; Jean Monnet, Saint-Etienne France and it will be held at Telecom Saint-Etienne.
            </p>

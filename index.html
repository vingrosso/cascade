            <p>
CASCADE is a new conference and the merge of COSADE and CARDIS. Its main goal is to encourage research and exchange on cryptographic implementations and embedded security challenges. It welcomes contributions from academia and industry. CASCADE encourages in particular submissions by European PhD students willing to present their work while benefiting from:
            </p>
            
            <ul>
                <li> a constructive review process prioritizing technical and editorial feedback over taste,
                <li> interactions with their research community without long-distance travels,
                <li> exposure to industrial challenges that may generate new research discussions.
               
            </ul>
            <p>
Papers can be submitted for review on two dates (one in the summer, one in the winter) for a single event in April.
